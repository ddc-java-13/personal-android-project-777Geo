## Summary



Play a high-speed variation on the classic counting game (and programming interview task): Fling randomly generated numbers to one of the 4 sides of the screen, depending on whether each number is a “fizz” (divisible by 3), “buzz” (divisible by 5), “fizz-buzz” (divisible by 3 and 5), or “other” (divisible by neither 3 nor 5). Play for a pre-configured length of time, with other configuration settings controlling maximum length of time each value is displayed and upper bound of generated values.

## Intended users

As a novice programmer I need a application like FizzBuzz that i can develop and can display my understanding of coding so that i can show employers my strengths and sharpen my weaknesses.

As a Software engineering employer I can utilize FuzzBuzz challenges and review programs to gauge how effectively someone may code

As a teacher I can use the Fuzzbuzz application to teach the classic division game in a more engaging manner

## Functionality

My software will be designed to test a Users ability in programming and producing solutions themselves.
## Persistent data

TBH.. Random Number Generator, Fizzbuzz answer verifier    
## Device/external services

TBD
## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

TBD
