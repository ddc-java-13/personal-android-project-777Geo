## Summary



Play a high-speed variation on the classic counting game (and programming interview task): Fling randomly generated numbers to one of the 4 sides of the screen, depending on whether each number is a “fizz” (divisible by 3), “buzz” (divisible by 5), “fizz-buzz” (divisible by 3 and 5), or “other” (divisible by neither 3 nor 5). Play for a pre-configured length of time, with other configuration settings controlling maximum length of time each value is displayed and upper bound of generated values.
